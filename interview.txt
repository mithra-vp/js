1. What is the difference between synchronous & asynchronous operations?
ans : synchronous operations is a line by line execution and asynchronous operations is like  independant operation like give a time delay for every funcion. 

2. What is dom?
ans : Dom is stands for document object model that refers to dom is a programing interface provided by Browser it allows javascript to access manipulate the structure style and content of the webpage.

3. What are the data types in js?
ans : primitive data types and non-primitive data types
    The primitive ( that ar immutable that means no changes and stores single value )datatypes are=> 
    string - "mithra", 'mithra'
    number - 1,2,3,4,4
    boolean - it has only true or false value
    undefined - undefined values
    null - absants of value
    Sympols - unique values

    non primitive datatypes (mutable that means we can change it and store multiple values ) datatypes are =>

    array - multiple values in a single variable
    object - object has keyvalue pairs (eg: name(mithra):mithra(value));

4. What is an event in js?
ans : event is an action or occurance that happens to the browser , handling the event is called event handling

5. What are closure in js?
ans : closure - it has outer function & inner function after the execution the inner function can access the variables, methods etc from outer function

6. What the difference between map and forEach?
ans : map and forEach are array itration methods 
    map - when condition satisfied then the returned data creates a new array [array itration]
    forEach -  executes a function for each elements in the array(does not return)

7. What is a callback function in js?
ans : function passing inside another function as an argument this is called callBack function

8. What is inheritance in js?

ans : query selectorall - return all matches
      query selector  - return with the first match

12. What is the difference between null and undefined?

13. What is the difference between = & ===?
ans : the difference between = and  === is. =  Itâ€™s used to assign a value to a variable. === It compares both value and data type

14. What is hoisting?
ans : hoisted means call the function before define the function

15. What is '.this' keyword in js?
ans : 

16. What are the different way to define a function?
ans : a funcion means a block of code that perform a particular task. a function defined by different ways that are ---
    1. funcion declaration - function declaration is the one of the ways to define function . the key features are - hoisting, must have a function name, globaly or localy scoped
    2. funcion expression - function expression is a way to define a function inside an expression and assign into a variable . key features like anonymous, named , not hoisted
    3. arrow function -arrow function is a shorter syntax for writing functions in java script ,also introduced in ES6(ECMA SCRIPT 2015)
    4. callback function - function passing inside another function as an argument this is called callBack function
    5. anonymous function - function is defined without a name is called anonymous function
    5. iife - IIFE - immediately invoked function expression,call the function before run the document - IMMEDIATELY INVOKED FUNCTION EXPRESSION
       1. immediately invoked
       2. data privacy - variables defined inside iife are not accessible outside
       3. closure - it has outer function & inner function after the execution the inner function can access the variables, methods etc from outer function
    self containe - executes independantly with effecting surrounding code
    
    6. predefined functions - pre-defined functions are function that are aleardy provided by javascript(built-in functions or native methods)
      . string function
      . math function
      . date function


17. What is the purpose of let ,var, const keyword in js?
ans : let, var, const keywords are used to declare a variable 
      let - re-declaration is not possible but re-assignment is possible and block scoped
      var - redclare,reassign ,function scoped
      const - there is no change it is constant

18. What is the difference between primitive & non primitive datatypes?
ans : primitive data types and non-primitive data types
    The primitive ( that ar immutable that means no changes and stores single value )datatypes are=> 
    string - "mithra", 'mithra'
    number - 1,2,3,4,4
    boolean - it has only true or false value
    undefined - undefined values
    null - absants of value
    Sympols - unique values

    non primitive datatypes (mutable that means we can change it and store multiple values ) datatypes are =>

    array - multiple values in a sngle variable
    object - object has keyvalue pairs (eg: name(mithra):mithra(value));


19. What the use of spread operators in js?
ans : the spread operator(...) in js is used to spread out elements of an array or the properties of an object
